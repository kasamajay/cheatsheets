how to setup docker containers as build agents for jenkins
 you been writing jenkins pipelines for a while but you have been 
 contrained to the tooling that's been available on your agents
 but its possible that you no longer had to be constrained by specific versions of specific tools on specific agents
 and that pipeline authors have full control over the tooling 
 that you are using just by having docker available on your agents

jenkins lts controller 2.289.2, 
 attached to that controller i have agent with label of linux, on this agent installed docker runtime

jenkins controller > manage jenkins > manage plugins > available > docker pipeline 1.26
  restart
  logback into jenkins controller
  
Jenkinsfile-1
pipeline {
    agent {
      docker { image 'node:16-alpine' }
    }

    stages {
        stage('Hello') {
            steps {
                sh 'node --version'
            }
        }
    }
}
